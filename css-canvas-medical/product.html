            learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every<br>
            patient you see.

            improve quality and increase revenue day after day.<br>
            Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so<br>

            ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up.  We're<br>
            a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of<br>
            coders to catch everything.  The automation in Canvas has<br>
